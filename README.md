# How to run the project

## Best way

For setting up the environment, we recommend using the [`devenv`](https://devenv.sh/) tool, and we will assume you will be using it for this guide. After `devenv` has been installed, following the guide in their page, to execute our code is as simple as running `devenv shell` inside our project folder and then running `python hanabi.py`

## The `pip` alternative

We also provide a `requirements.txt` file, but we haven't tested it and aren't sure if it works.
